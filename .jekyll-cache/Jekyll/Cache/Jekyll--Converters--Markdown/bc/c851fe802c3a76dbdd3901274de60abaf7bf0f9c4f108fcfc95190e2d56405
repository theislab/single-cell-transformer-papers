<p>This repository accompanies <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-024-02353-z">Transformers in Single-Cell Omics: A Review and New Perspectives</a>. Please refer to the manuscript for the details.</p>

<p>We provide a curated list of single-cell transformers and their evaluation results. We skip models that work only on bulk or images of slides data and those where transformers are used only as a part of the model. Models focusing on sequential data, such as DNA or protein sequences are omitted too. New entries are added at the top of the corresponding table.</p>

<p>We welcome contributions to this repository. Please open a pull request or an issue if you want to add or edit an entry.</p>
